# Pyfun 🐍✨

Welcome to my **Pyfun** repository! 

This is a collection of my small Python projects and learning experiments. I created this space to practice coding, track my progress, and share my journey as I explore the world of programming.

## 📂 What's Inside?

You'll find various beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects here, such as:

-   **Games** (like Word Guessing Game, Calculator, etc.)
-   **Simple Tools & Utilities**
-   **Scripts** that automate small tasks
-   **Learning experiments** with new Python concepts

Each project is contained in its own folder for clarity.

## 🚀 My Goal

This repository serves as my public coding diary—a place to store ideas, improve my skills, and connect with other learners and developers.
